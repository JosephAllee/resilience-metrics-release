# Optional Grafana Stack
This project focuses on providing reproducible, static outputs (JSON, SVG, PNG).
However, for advanced users wishing to integrate with their own monitoring systems, a pre-configured Grafana stack is available as an option. The `docker-compose.yml` file and provisioning configurations can be found in the `grafana/` directory.

## To start the stack:
Navigate to the `grafana/` directory and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

No official support is provided for this stack.

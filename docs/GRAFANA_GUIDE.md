# Grafana Integration Guide (Resilience-Metrics)

This guide explains how to visualize `resilience-metrics` results in a Grafana dashboard.

## 1. Prerequisites

* A working Grafana instance.
* A results file `analysis.json` generated by `resiliencectl`.
* The "JSON API" plugin for Grafana (or any equivalent plugin able to read local/remote JSON).

## 2. Import the sample dashboard

The easiest way to start is to import the provided dashboard.

1. In Grafana, go to "Dashboards".
2. Click "New" then "Import".
3. Paste the contents of `examples/grafana/dashboard.json` or upload it directly.
4. The "Resilience Analysis" dashboard should appear.

## 3. Configure a data source

Configure a data source pointing to your `analysis.json` so the dashboard can read your analyses.

*(This section will be expanded with JSON API plugin instructions.)*

## 4. Bind data to panels

Each panel is configured to pull a specific metric from the JSON file.

*(This section will describe using JSONPath queries to target fields like `refusal_index` or `tracking_error`.)*
